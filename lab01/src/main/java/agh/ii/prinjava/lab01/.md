## 1) Concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, an polymorphism

**1.  Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is a way of bundling together of publicly accessible methods and privately accessible data.
It is also a process of data hiding and used to have controlled access to the object properties.

It can be implemented by declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

**2. Mutator (setter) and accessor (getter) method**

Getters and setters are methods used to access the private attributes (or properties) of an object in a class.
- Getters are used to retrieve the value of an attribute
- Setters are used to modify the value of an attribute.

**3. This**

"This" is a reference variable, like a pointor that refers to the current object instance.
"This"  is generally used to differentiate local variables (or method parameters) from class instance attributes that have the same name.

**4. Super**

"Super" is used in overriding to access members of the parent class from the child class.

**5. Inheritance**

Inheritance is a mecanism of code reuse and creation of relationship between class (parent & child class).

Inheritance is implemented with the "extends" keyword.

**6. Polymorphism**

Polymorphism is the ability of a reference variable to take different forms.
Polymorphism's three main forms are :
- ad-hoc polymorphism (overloading of operators, functions, or methods)
- subtype/inclusion polymorphism (ability of a reference variable to take different forms)
- parametric polymorphism (Java Generics)

Polymorphism can be implemented using method overloading and overriding.


**7. Relationship between inheritance and sub-type/inclusion polymorphism**

Inheritance is when a child class is created that inherits the features from the parent class. And polymorphism is the ability to define one interface and have multiple implementation.
The inheritance and sub-type/inclusion polymorphism are both used to code reuse. But inheritance is applied to classes whereas polymorphism is applied to functions and methods.

**8. Testable method**

The testable methods are `getPropVal()` and `setPropVal` which are the getters and setters, and the method `isEncapsulated()` which is a method who return a boolean value and indicate whether encapsulation is applied.

*HelloEncapsulationTest.java :*
````
package agh.ii.prinjava.lab01.lst01_01;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class HelloEncapsulationTest {

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        System.out.println("HelloEncapsulationTest.setUp...");
    }

    @AfterEach
    void tearDown() {
        System.out.println("HelloEncapsulationTest.tearDown...");
    }

    void testGetPropVal() {
        HelloEncapsulation enDemo = new HelloEncapsulation(12);

        int propVal = enDemo.getPropVal();

        assertEquals(12, propVal);
    }

    void testSetPropVal() {
        HelloEncapsulation enDemo = new HelloEncapsulation(3);

        enDemo.setPropVal(12);
        int propVal = enDemo.getPropVal();

        assertEquals(12, propVal);
    }

    void testIsEncapsulated() {
        HelloEncapsulation enDemo = new HelloEncapsulation(3);

        boolean encapsulated = enDemo.isEncapsulated();

        assertTrue(encapsulated);
    }
}

## 2) Static members (variables/constants and methods)

**1. Concept of static**
- A static variable is a value that all objects of a class can access and modify. 
- A static constant is like a fixed value that doesn't change and is available to all objects of a class. 
- A static method is like a function that belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects.
